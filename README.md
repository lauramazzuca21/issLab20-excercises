# Ingegneria dei Sistemi Software (Software Systems Engineering)

This repository contains the excercises we do during lessons and at home for the subject.

During this course we learn how to design software systems following the Agile framework and how to work with modeling languages. The modeling language we use is a custom language inspired by the akka actor model. This modeling language should help application designer in defining working models of distributed systems based on actors that behave as Finite State Machines.
